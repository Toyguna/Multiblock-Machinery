# Multiblock Machinery


## What is Multiblock Machinery?
Multiblock Machinery is a mod designed
for modpack makers in mind.

The mod allows the user to create highly
customizable custom multiblock machines
with custom recipes, structures (including
blocks and size), textures and more; via the use of JSON 
files for functionality, PNG files for 
custom texture and MP3 files for custom
sounds. (No custom texture or sfx are 
required; as a catalogue of selectable 
sounds and textures are already loaded in 
with the mod. 


## How customizable are the multiblocks?
The mod is designed with the user in mind.
The customization options are very wide as
the mod allows you to customize the multiblock
so much so that the multiblock may almost have 
no tracable trademark left from the mod.

A multiblock's functionality
can be customized the following ways:
 - Recipes
 - Size and Structure
 - Textures
 - Sounds
 - Recipe voiding result upon full output?
 - Recipe voiding result upob no appropriate
output?
 - Rain sensitive?
 - Machine upgrades allowance


## Other Additions:
 - Machine upgrades
 - Machine detector covers


## Other notes:
Recipe Customizability:
 - Input ingredients (Items/Fluid ; can be multiple)
 - Output result (Items/Fluid ; can be multiple)
 - Process time (in ticks)
 - Energy requirement (RF / EU ; conversion can be enabled)
 - Void upon energy failure?
 - Reset progress upon energy failure?

The functionality will change depending on
structure blocks. (ex. Exhaust Vent will require an
open air block next to it to function.)

The custom mutliblocks have some default
functionality that can't be modified:
 - Multiblock process disabling (via a
soft mallet or a GT version)
 -
